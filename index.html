<p><strong>Cheap dog tags have a nice variety of designs, shapes, and colors.</strong> You may find them in a size that is quite large or just small. You may also get them with engravings, while others will simply use a text string.</p>
<p><strong>Another thing that you may find about cheap dog tags is that they may come with a unique back and insert. These back and insert designations could help your dog remember you when you are out shopping.</strong> A good one is going to be imprinted with the names of both the dog owner and the dog. Another way that this makes a difference is that the dog owner may even have the name engraved on the tags.</p>

        <p>For most people, the start of the summer is a pleased event. There will be pool parties, barbecues, and many trips to amusement parks. But for our beloved pets, facing rising temperatures without precautionary measures in place could lead to premature death, one that could be avoided.</p>
<p>Our pets are just as keen for some fun in the sun but just like for humans, we must remember to take some careful measures to ensure they can withstand the summer heat to avoid a host of other potential problems. Below are some life-saving tips:</p>
<h2 id="Beware-Of-Lawns"><a href="#Beware-Of-Lawns" class="headerlink" title="Beware Of Lawns:"></a>Beware Of Lawns:</h2><p>Neighboring lawns or large fields at parks should be one of the largest concerns for pet owners, especially dog owners. The reason for this is due to pesticides, fertilizers, and insecticides being used by many homeowners to protect their lawns when warm ride out arrives.</p>
<h2 id="Plants"><a href="#Plants" class="headerlink" title="Plants:"></a>Plants:</h2><p>There are certain plants and flowers, if ingested can be quite harmful to pets. As reported by the Humane Society of the United States, more than 700 plants has been named as producing toxic substances that can be harmful to animals.</p>
<p>You may even have some of them in your very own backyard such as apple trees (seeds can be harmful to an animal’s health) and holy shrubs (berries fall into the fatal category). Although it may be impossible, as a pet owner, to avoid lawns entirely, be very mindful of the surrounding whenever you and your pet are out taking a leisurely walk around the neighborhood.</p>
<h2 id="Certain-Temperatures-Must-Be-Avoided"><a href="#Certain-Temperatures-Must-Be-Avoided" class="headerlink" title="Certain Temperatures Must Be Avoided:"></a>Certain Temperatures Must Be Avoided:</h2><p>It’s only natural to want to take your pet along with you on routine errands once the warm ride out returns. Taking car trips to the supermarket and the post office may seem relatively harmless but, in fact, it can turn into a very perilous situation for your pet.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for cars to heat up even when parked in the shade. The temperature inside a car can reach 120 F in a matter of minutes, as this is common on a hot day. Pet owners will more than likely have the air conditioning on while they’re driving • ” the AC is typically turned off once being paid out of the car.</p>
<p>This leaves pets to sit in what rapidly becomes sweltering heat. The consequences are many: heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and even brain hurt can occur. The safest route to take is to, in general, during summer months, to leave your pet at home as you go out to run errands.</p>
<h2 id="Heart-Worm-Protection-Symptoms-Of-Dog-Worms"><a href="#Heart-Worm-Protection-Symptoms-Of-Dog-Worms" class="headerlink" title="Heart Worm Protection/Symptoms Of Dog Worms:"></a>Heart Worm Protection/Symptoms Of Dog Worms:</h2><p>During the chill, many pet owners stop giving their pets heart worm medication. You will find that most veterinarians are accepting of this because heart worm is transmitted through mosquitoes, which aren’t present during the colder months.</p>
<p>A dry cough can sometimes be a sign of heart worm. Other worms might cause a decrease in weight or difficulty in gaining weight. Be sure to check your pet’s stool as it may also contain worms as well.</p>
<p>Pet owners should resume giving their pets the heart worm medication over again once the ride out heats up. The reason for this is because heart worm is a blood disease that can be very painful for pets. At the point of infection, the heart worm lava can grow and turn into worms, which then live in the blood vessels surrounding the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Recommended reading:<br><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/health/gallery/pets-and-our-health-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/health/gallery/pets-and-our-health-wellness/index.html</a></p>
<p>What comes next is the adult worms start to mate and circulate throughout an animal’s bloodstream. Since the cost of prevention is relatively low, many veterinarians are amazed at the prevalence of heart worm. Although heart worm is indeed treatable once an animal has been infected, such treatment can be excruciatingly painful for the animal.</p>
<p><strong>But there is excellent news: This fate can be avoided.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p>By simply giving your pet • ” although heart worm is most commonly transmitted to dogs, it can infect cats, too • ” heart worm medication long before the start of spring. To be on the safe side, continue the medication all year round.</p>
<p>The responsible pet owner will be careful to take mental notes of how much activity their pet can handle in warmer ride out. Dogs with thick coats, fleeting-nosed dogs, and senior dogs generally experience fantastic difficulty handling a lot of activity as they normally do in other seasons.</p>
<p>This of course, is not a license for them not to exercise, but pet owners should be very mindful about when these types of pets get their exercise. The best times would be ahead of schedule morning or evening hours because the temperature is at its’ coolest.</p>
<h2 id="Avoid-Summer-Carnivals-Fairs-With-Pets"><a href="#Avoid-Summer-Carnivals-Fairs-With-Pets" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Summer Carnivals/Fairs With Pets:"></a>Avoid Summer Carnivals/Fairs With Pets:</h2><p>For many pets, heat can cause them a fantastic deal of stress. And if you add on the mixture of large crowds and loud noises, this can cause your pets to suffer from anxiety.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, it is generally a excellent thought to leave pets in the home when attending such gatherings and this includes revelry such as: Fourth of July fireworks as this can trigger anxiety in pets and should be avoided.</p>

        <p><strong>Leash training your puppy will teach your dog how to walk politely by your side without pulling. It makes walking your dog a pleasure instead of a test of strength.</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>You can start training your puppy on a leash on short walks as early as 6 to 7 weeks of age. Keep the sessions short. Allow your pet to explore and then call his attention to have him come closer. When he does, reward him with praise and a treat.</p>
<p>Your puppy will likely start to get the idea and begin to follow you to get more treats. Since his attention span will be short, release your pup and let him explore again.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>It should be easy to get your puppy to walk beside you since she is used to getting a treat when she comes. Staying with you will become routine.</p>
<p>If you want you can start the training in an area (such as your own backyard) that the pup is already familiar with. A new location offers tempting smells and different things to explore.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>Call your puppy with a, “Let’s Go” command. When she comes, give her a treat and praise her. Do this a few times so that she relates “Let’s Go” to come and get a treat.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>Give the “Let’s Go” command and walk a few paces with your puppy. If your dog walks with you, reward and praise her.</p>
<p>If she resists and does not follow you - no treat. Give the command and start walking again. When you pup follows, reward and treat.</p>
<p>Soon your puppy will be walking beside you on a leash and not ever realize it!</p>
<p>Teaching your puppy can be enjoyable for both and your dog if done with short training sessions. Remember, treats are only rewarded for the correct behavior.</p>
<h3 id="Boundary-Training"><a href="#Boundary-Training" class="headerlink" title="Boundary Training"></a>Boundary Training</h3><p>This lesson could literally save your dog’s life one day……and stop them from charging out a door and into the street!</p>
<p>(This is another “must see” dog training video.)</p>
<p>Does your dog bolt through the yard gate? Have you spent nights roaming the neighborhood looking for your dog after he or she ran out of the yard? This lesson in the dog training video library will help you. Believe me. When you teach your dog boundaries you will be so relieved.Boundary training comes in handy and allows you to control your dog as you enter or leave your home.  Boundary training gives you time to take off your shoes and jacket at the front door, and to put down your groceries.</p>

<li>Pick up loose dog hard with a damp sponge or dampened rubber glove</li>
<li>Place a washable towel or blanket where your dog likes to sleep</li>
<li>If your puppy sits on your lap, keep a lint brush nearby to collect the hair before you get up</li>

<ul>
<li>Bathing your dog regularly will definitely cut down on doggie odor</li>
<li>If it’s too cold to bathe your dog, use a dry shampoo or massage some baking soda into your dog’s coat and brush it out</li>

</ul>
<p>My training method will reward you too with a terrific feeling of accomplishment for what you achieve with your dog.</p>
<p>The idea is to have short (5 minute) training sessions that are FUN for your dog.  Dogs love to please and they love being rewarded for the “right” behavior.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>There are so many people out there selling themselves as dog trainers.</strong></p>
<p>A poor trainer may cause more problems or at the least not help you at all.  You may be given interesting information, but lack a long-term solution after the trainer has left.</p>
<p>So is there really a sure-proof training system?  Of course.  We want to help you know what to look for.</p>
<p>DTO promotes a system of training, based on credentials that are peer reviewed.</p>
<p>Positive Training is based on your dog learning through treat incentive.  We do not promote punishment techniques or any system that works with pain or dominance.</p>
<p>Dove follows guidelines that are set Internationally for good training practice. Through the Certification Council of Dog Trainers, she is  Certified Dog Trainer Knowledge Assessed.   This is why you can trust DTO with your dog.</p>
<p>You can find dog trainers with all sorts of credentials, and indeed experience.</p>
<p>Certified Dog Trainer Knowledge Assessed follows strict and ongoing reviews to assure best practices.   The Certification of Dog Trainers Council assures that the latest science and studies are included in their training system.</p>
<p><strong>There are three main prongs to the system of care for dogs:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Training - the belief is that by exercising your dog mentally you are setting up your dog for a happy and healthy life</p>
</li>
<li><p>Behavioural attention</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health assessment.  A problem can be due to health.  Perhaps your dog is in pain, and this is causing him to act out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Veterinarians have very specific training.</strong>Today they are more and more trained in behavioural issues.  However; remember that sometimes they can miss issues because veterinarian school failed to give training in reading a dog’s behaviour.  This doesn’t mean that they are not helping your dog, only that their information is very specific.</p>
<p><strong>Nutriton is a key factor to a healthy and happy dog, but we won’t address that here.</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, if you delve a little deeper you will also find that some professed trainers are assessed within a franchise.  They add credentials to their title but these are recognized within their own system. From our experience we find these systems are expensive.  We find these systems can apply good techniques in portions, but we also find that their business model does not have the vigorousness of being peer reviewed.</p>
<p><em>As many a ways as there is to treat our health as humans, there are systems to help our dog.</em>  DTO is mainly interested in encouraging good training technique.  We provide fun games as well as tips for crate training…  We believe applying DTO training daily for 10 minutes at a time you are setting your dog and you up for success. Dove does not use force with her dogs.  Those people who profess pain techniques like prong collars as the only way should know dominance and pain can provide results but they are short term.  Dove has trained dogs on television, as well as helped thousands of dog owners.  She knows methods that protect the safety of humans and dogs alike.</p>
<p>DTO however knows that the positive training in your home is not always the best and most effective for more troubled dogs.  Your care and love for your dog is unquestioned, however; you may need an expert to intervene for more problematic situations. We encourage you to find a dog trainer specifically trained in behavioural issues.  While we have included some basic and important information on behaviour that will help you as a dog owner recognize best technique, there sometimes is no replacement for one-on-one with a dog expert.  We know that there is no reason to waste time when there are issues of human safety at hand. You need an expert who can read your dog.</p>
<p>If you are interested to taking an extra step to work with a live trainer we guide you to Certified Dog Trainers in your area from the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers.   The CCPDT website has a full list of trainers in Canada, the US and worldwide.</p>
<p>If your dog is not exerting troubled behaviours and you just want that extra bit of one-on-one training. Great!  Find someone like Dove who is Certified Dog Trainer Knowledge Assessed.</p>
<p>If you have a dog with behavioural problems however; please be guided to Certified Dog Trainer Knowledge and Skills Assessed.  These trainers are specifically skilled in dog behaviour.  They will have slightly different and applied skills from Dove, the resident trainer at DTO.</p>
<p>We hope this has helped clarify Dog Training credentials.  We hear so often people say that they spent so much money on a trainer, and still their dog is not behaving.</p>
<p>In short when looking for a dog trainer look for CPDT-KA and CPDT-KSA.</p>
