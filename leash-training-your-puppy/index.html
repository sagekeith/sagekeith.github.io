        <p><strong>Leash training your puppy will teach your dog how to walk politely by your side without pulling. It makes walking your dog a pleasure instead of a test of strength.</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>You can start training your puppy on a leash on short walks as early as 6 to 7 weeks of age. Keep the sessions short. Allow your pet to explore and then call his attention to have him come closer. When he does, reward him with praise and a treat.</p>
<p>Your puppy will likely start to get the idea and begin to follow you to get more treats. Since his attention span will be short, release your pup and let him explore again.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>It should be easy to get your puppy to walk beside you since she is used to getting a treat when she comes. Staying with you will become routine.</p>
<p>If you want you can start the training in an area (such as your own backyard) that the pup is already familiar with. A new location offers tempting smells and different things to explore.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>Call your puppy with a, “Let’s Go” command. When she comes, give her a treat and praise her. Do this a few times so that she relates “Let’s Go” to come and get a treat.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>Give the “Let’s Go” command and walk a few paces with your puppy. If your dog walks with you, reward and praise her.</p>
<p>If she resists and does not follow you - no treat. Give the command and start walking again. When you pup follows, reward and treat.</p>
<p>Soon your puppy will be walking beside you on a leash and not ever realize it!</p>
<p>Teaching your puppy can be enjoyable for both and your dog if done with short training sessions. Remember, treats are only rewarded for the correct behavior.</p>
<h3 id="Boundary-Training"><a href="#Boundary-Training" class="headerlink" title="Boundary Training"></a>Boundary Training</h3><p>This lesson could literally save your dog’s life one day……and stop them from charging out a door and into the street!</p>
<p>(This is another “must see” dog training video.)</p>
<p>Does your dog bolt through the yard gate? Have you spent nights roaming the neighborhood looking for your dog after he or she ran out of the yard? This lesson in the dog training video library will help you. Believe me. When you teach your dog boundaries you will be so relieved.Boundary training comes in handy and allows you to control your dog as you enter or leave your home.  Boundary training gives you time to take off your shoes and jacket at the front door, and to put down your groceries.</p>
<p>If you follow my method your dog will be trained in no time, even if you have a pack of dogs!<br>And remember! Keep sessions short and your dog will look forward to training!</p>

<h3 id="Removing-Dog-Hair"><a href="#Removing-Dog-Hair" class="headerlink" title="Removing Dog Hair"></a>Removing Dog Hair</h3><p>If you don’t want to be vacuuming all the time, try these quick tips instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a dampened mop on hardwood or vinyl floors</li>
<li>Pick up loose dog hard with a damp sponge or dampened rubber glove</li>
<li>Place a washable towel or blanket where your dog likes to sleep</li>
<li>If your puppy sits on your lap, keep a lint brush nearby to collect the hair before you get up</li>
<li>To remove hair from your bedding, run sheets and blankets through the air-dry or fluff cycle of your dryer before putting it in the washing machine</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Getting-Rid-of-Doggy-Smell"><a href="#Getting-Rid-of-Doggy-Smell" class="headerlink" title="Getting Rid of Doggy Smell!"></a>Getting Rid of Doggy Smell!</h3><p>Other dogs may find the smell of your dog like expensive perfume but if you’re not quite as thrilled with it here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bathing your dog regularly will definitely cut down on doggie odor</li>
<li>If it’s too cold to bathe your dog, use a dry shampoo or massage some baking soda into your dog’s coat and brush it out</li>
<li>Add some odor-neutralizers when you do the laundry</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Cleaning-Up-After-Your-Dog-Eats"><a href="#Cleaning-Up-After-Your-Dog-Eats" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning Up After Your Dog Eats"></a>Cleaning Up After Your Dog Eats</h3><ul>
<li>Coat your dog’s bowl with vegetable cooking spray or</li>
<li>Purchase a non-tip bowl</li>
<li>Place your dog’s bowl on a tray (instead of a place mat)</li>
</ul>
<p>My training method will reward you too with a terrific feeling of accomplishment for what you achieve with your dog.</p>
<p>The idea is to have short (5 minute) training sessions that are FUN for your dog.  Dogs love to please and they love being rewarded for the “right” behavior.</p>
