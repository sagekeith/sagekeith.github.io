<h2 id="How-Do-You-Remember-A-Dead-Pet"><a href="#How-Do-You-Remember-A-Dead-Pet" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Remember A Dead Pet"></a>How Do You Remember A Dead Pet</h2><ul>
<li>Plan a memorial service – Usually, the pets we keep in our house are either dogs or cats. And they are the ones with whom we can enjoy each and every moment without getting bored. So, they are also a part of your family and you will follow all the rituals for the funeral. Plan a remembrance ceremony in their honor, invite your close friends and take turns on the memories and share it with others.</li>
<li>Visit the places where you use to spend time together. Try to remember the activity your pet does when it was left open, these things will make you feel more comfortable and you will remember those days.</li>
<li>Create a stone in your garden with your pet’s name and write a quote saying “ for your love you shared with me” on it.</li>
<li>Frame a picture of your pet or the animal and keep it with you. If the pet had any marks like a collar or any tag then keep that in the tag too.</li>
<li>After you lose a pet, donate it to any local animal shelter. They also may feel good while interacting with other people there.</li>
<li>If you are talented enough then you can create any memorable gift for them with your skills or make art which you will remember for life.</li>
<li>If you owe any bakery or restaurant then you can name any dish on your pet’s name. Moreover, you can make it a special dish for your bakery or café to make it more memorable.</li>
<li>During the grieving process, stay with the people who are close to you and your pet. They will support you in the entire process and will be there in your tough time to recover you quickly.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is better to believe it that they are no more physically as it can be the best way to memorialize.</li>
